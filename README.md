# titanic_death_Prediction
PROJECT DESCRIPTION: In this project i have predicted that which passengersurvived the titanic ship wreck using Logistic regresion.
in order to predict the death of a particular passenger i have used some other standards of correctness which are as: ï‚· Precision ï‚· Recall ï‚· F1-score ï‚· Support These all standard of correctness are depend upon the Actual and Predict class, so i draw a 2Ã—2 confusion matrix .

DATASET: link:https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic
The dataset have been splitted into 2 parts that are test.csv and train.csv .
The training set is used to build our machine learning models. our model will be based on â€œfeaturesâ€ like passengersâ€™ gender and class. 
The test set is used to see how well our model performs on unseen data.


LOGISTIC REGRESSION:
Logistic regression is a statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable, although many more complex extensions exist. In regression analysis, logistic regression (or logit regression) is estimating the parameters of a logistic model (a form of binary regression).

RESULT:
the result is in the titanic.csv file
